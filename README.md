# Online Personal Portfolio
This project was an opportunity for me to put basic web development technologies into practice after school. I was able to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the site, and utilized Bootstrap for structure and jQuery to automate the copyright date.

- Designed responsive custom static site showcasing portfolio projects for job candidate’s ongoing professional use
- Streamlined a lean presentation of candidate’s value proposition and funneled attention to the call to action
- Automated setup for hosting, pointing DNS at the site, and using jQuery to update each year
